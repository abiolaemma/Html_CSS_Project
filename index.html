                I am an AWS Certified Associate Solutions Architect with 400+ training hours in cloud-based infrastructure, well-architected framework design, networking fundamentals, security, computer programming, and data migration. As an IT professional, I am interested in attaining a career that will allow me 
                to excel in a cloud-based environment, as well as implement a fault-tolerant and reliable infrastructure.  
                Looking forward to discussing opportunities that would allow me to bring the skillset, professionalism, 
                and dedication necessary to deliver customer-centric services. As a technical problem solver, I have a track 
                record of success. It is my passionate goal to help people solve business problems through cloud-based technology, 
                to put a smile on their faces, and to inspire others to do the same. 
                As well as reading, listening to music, writing, 
                and going to the gym, I love to stay up to date with all the latest technological innovations. I love long distance running too, 
                but have never trained for a marathon. Perhaps someday I'll be able to do it. 
                
                Having the ability to solve a problem for someone is one of the things that 
                makes me most happy about my technical skills. I'm writing a blog about AWS, please check it out <a href="https://medium.com/@abiolaemma2014" target="_blank">here!</a>.
